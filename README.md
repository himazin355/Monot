# Monot
This is a text editor for programming.
## Functionally
Monot doesn't have much functionality. 
There isnâ€˜t even a save function.
## Before it functionally
Monot aims to be a text editor for programming.

Therefore, I want to make it a lightweight and multifunctional text editor.
Features we would like to implement in the future include the following: 
* Syntax highlights
* Save
* Git
* Markdown
* Run Python
* Text completion 
* Preview files
